# Record Linkage Annotator

Work in progress.

Record Linkage Annotator is a lightweight browser-based user interface for
manually classifying record pairs. This application is part of the 
[Python Record Linkage Toolkit](https://github.com/J535D165/recordlinkage). 
An hosted version of [Record Linkage Annotator](https://j535d165.github.io/recordlinkage-annotator/)
can be found on Github.

The [Github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) hosted version of [Record Linkage Annotator](https://j535d165.github.io/recordlinkage-annotator/) makes use of client side Javascript only. The tool doesn't upload
data. Not convided about the safety of your data? That's fine. You can 
deploy the code yourself locally. Please read the local deployment instructions.
